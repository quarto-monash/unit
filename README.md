Monash unit template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating a Monash University unit website. 

To get started:

1. Install the template with `quarto use template quarto-monash/unit`
2. Save to `github.com/numbats/<unit>` repository
3. Go to repo Settings/Pages and set Custom domain to `<unit>.numbat.space` and set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Set up CNAME record (Rob manages these).

Example units set up with this template (or similar) are: [ETC5512](https://wcd.numbat.space), [ETC5513](https://rcp.numbat.space), [ETC5521](https://ddde.numbat.space), [ETC5523](https://cwd.numbat.space), [ETC5500](https://af.numbat.space),
